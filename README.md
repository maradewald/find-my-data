# Find My Data

_A work in progress._

Ever curious about which websites and apps let you download a copy of your own data? Here's a list of them with a link to complete the download process, as well as a brief description of what you'll be returned. Most of these sites take some time to compile and return a downloadable source to you (a number of hours or up to a few days).

List of sites compiled thus far:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Spotify
- Snapchat
- Instagram

### Facebook

**How**

[_How do I download a copy of my information on Facebook?_](https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644) (Help Center article)

**What**

Facebook will let you select a date range, file format (`HTML` or `JSON`), and a media quality (high/medium/low). They also provide a list of categories of information such as your posts, photos and videos, comments, etc. from which you can select exactly what you want to download. It defaults to select all of your information.

### Twitter

**How**

[_How to download your Twitter archive_](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive) (Help Center article)

**What**

You'll get emailed a link with a `.zip` file of your Twitter archive.

_At the time of writing this, there seems to be a bug within their settings
that causes the download data link to not appear. I'll update with more
information about what the archive looks like once I'm able to download it._

### Spotify

**How**

[_Can I download a copy of my personal data?_](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/) â€” the first dropdown question in their _Data rights and privacy settings_ page.

Spotify's [_Understanding my data_](https://support.spotify.com/us/account_payment_help/privacy/understanding-my-data/) article goes into detail about the data you receive. In summary, you'll get several `JSON` files that split your data into categories such as playlists, streaming history, search queries, and more.
